In this project, I created a set of simple admin utilities using Bash scripting. These utilities will
help perform basic administrative tasks on a Linux System. The utilities will be menu-driven, providing a
user-friendly interface to execute various functions.
The system shall prompt a user to enter a passcode, which is hard-coded in the script and shall be hidden
(password-like). If it is true, A sub-menu called Admin Utilities will appear that contains the following
items:
■ Memory Usage
■ CPU Usage
■ Disk Usage
■ Who’s There.
■ Show Network Information
